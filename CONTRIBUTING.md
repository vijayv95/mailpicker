# Contributing to MailPicker (mpkr)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MailPicker. The project is currently in **early development (Phase 0)** and is primarily a skeleton for the future C++ implementation. While functional contributions are not yet applicable, we welcome ideas, feedback, and preparatory contributions that do not alter the core skeleton.

---

## Current Status

* Project provides initial tooling, pre-commit hooks, and project structure.  
* No functional features are implemented yet.

**Do not submit pull requests for usage features at this stage.** Focus on documentation, architecture suggestions, or preparatory work that supports the skeleton.

---

## Branch and Commit Conventions

### Branch Naming

* Branch names **must include the related issue number** to enable automatic issue linking.  
  Example: `feature/123-add-auth`, `bugfix/45-fix-login`.  
* Use **descriptive names** that summarize the work being done.

### Commit Message Convention (according to octue/conventional-commits)

Commit messages must follow the 3‑letter uppercase prefix style enforced by the pre-commit hook. The allowed commit codes are:

```bash
FEA  – new feature  
ENH  – improvement / optimization  
FIX  – bug fix  
OPS  – operational / devops / CI/CI‑infrastructure changes  
DEP  – changes in dependencies  
REF  – refactoring existing code  
TST  – adding or updating tests  
MRG  – merge commit  
REV  – reversion (e.g. `git revert`)  
CHO  – chore (miscellaneous configuration changes)  
WIP  – work-in-progress commit (should be avoided in final commits)  
DOC  – documentation updates / docstrings / README etc.  
STY  – style or formatting changes  
```

Commit messages must match the form:

```bash
<CODE>: <Short subject>
```

Examples:

```bash
FEA: add OAuth2 PKCE login module  
FIX: correct index out-of-range in IMAP message parsing  
DOC: update CONTRIBUTING.md with commit conventions  
```

If required, you can optionally include a body after a blank line, and/or a footer. Breaking changes should follow the conventional‑commits rules (e.g. include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in body or footer).  

The pre-commit hook verifies conformance and rejects non-conforming messages.

## How to Contribute (Future Phases)

Once development progresses, contributions will be organized around the following areas:

### 1. Core Modules

* AuthManager  
* IMAP Client  
* DatabaseManager  
* SearchInterface (fzf wrapper)  
* ConfigManager  

### 2. Security & Infrastructure

* OAuth2 PKCE implementation  
* Secure token handling  
* Pre-commit and CI enhancements  
* Cross-platform build and packaging  

### 3. Documentation

* Developer guides  
* API documentation  
* Architecture diagrams  
* Tutorials  

### 4. Testing

* Unit tests for modules  
* Integration tests for IMAP and database  
* CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Pull Request Guidelines

* Branch name **must include the issue number** for automated issue linking.  
* The commit summary section in your PR will be automatically populated by the workflow between the `<!--- START AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->` and `<!--- END AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->` markers.  
* To skip autogenerated notes, include:  
  `<!--- SKIP AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->` in your PR description.  
* PR descriptions do **not** need to manually duplicate commit summaries.  

---

## Reporting Issues

Please use GitHub Issues for:

* Bug reports  
* Feature requests  
* Documentation improvements  
* Security concerns  

Be descriptive, include examples where applicable, and label your issue appropriately.

---

## Code Style and Guidelines

* Follow **C++20 standards**.  
* Adhere to `.clang-format` and `.clang-tidy` rules.  
* Include minimal MIT license headers in all new code.  
* Respect the modular structure; avoid unnecessary coupling between components.  
* Ensure commit messages conform to the octue/conventional-commits 3‑letter code standard.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the **MIT License**. See `LICENSE` for details.

## Notes

* This project is **under active development**.  
* Contributions may be reorganized as the architecture evolves.  
* Phase 0 contributions should focus on preparatory work, documentation, and tooling.  
* Phase 1+ contributions will include functional features, modules, tests, and CI/CD updates.
